Android Picture-in-Picture navigation sample
===================================

This sample is an extention of the official [sample on Picture-in-Picture(PIP)][0] from Google. 

Introduction
------------

This sample focuses on the navigation behavior when a PIP-able activity is deeper in the back-stack. The behavoir is different for fragment-based and activity-based navigation. There is a menu option to switch between the two navigation architectures when running the app.

You can read the [documentation][1] to learn more about PIP. There are two small blog posts on medium that also dive into PIP, [Making magic moments with PIP][2] and [Navigation patterns with PIP][3]

You can comment out the [`finish()`][4] method in `WatchActvitiy` to see how an app will act without accounting for losing the back-stack when restoring from PIP mode.
